- Using a fixed-size `array` to store sold-out products.
- Storing/loading all data from/to `.txt` files.
- Recursive input validation ensures safe entry of data.
- Exception handling prevents crashes on poor input. 

## How to Run
1. Open GitHub Codespaces that belong to this repo.
2. Execute `Main.java` as Java application.
3. Use the numbered menu to add, sell, display, and save inventory.

## Data Files
- `inventory.txt`: holds current inventory
- `soldout.txt`: holds sold items archive
